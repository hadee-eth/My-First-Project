# My-First-Project
The first project created with HTML and CSS based on the course of /supersimpledev

Creating this project took me about two weeks of coding despite the fact that I was busy with other stuff. Overall, it has been a splendid experience and a step to immerse myself into the world of Front-End Development. The course is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=3623s
